            Few works have excited more debate than this painting. The size and subject matter place it in the dignified tradition of portraiture familiar to Velázquez’s contemporaries, but the subject of this portrait is unclear. Velázquez shows himself at the easel in his studio in Madrid’s Alcázar palace. The central figure is that of the five-year-old infanta Margarita Teresa, daughter of King Philip IV and his second wife, Maria Anna. The child is flanked by two meninas (“ladies-in-waiting”). Also present in the foreground are two dwarfs and a large dog, while other courtiers appear elsewhere in the picture. The king and queen are reflected in the mirror on the back wall. Velázquez appears to be painting the royal couple as they pose beyond the easel, but the subject of the painting seems to be Margarita Teresa, who appears surprised by her parents’ entry into the room.
